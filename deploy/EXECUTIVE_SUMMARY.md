# Executive Summary: OCR Application EC2 Deployment

## Project Overview
Deploy the OCR application to AWS EC2 for permanent, always-on access, replacing the current local development setup with ngrok.

## Business Case

### Current State
- Application runs locally on developer machine
- Requires ngrok for external access (unreliable, not always online)
- Manual startup required for each use
- No production-grade monitoring or backup

### Proposed State
- Application runs on AWS EC2 (always online)
- Professional-grade infrastructure
- Automated backups and monitoring
- Scalable and secure deployment

## Financial Impact

### Monthly Cost: $34.50
- EC2 Instance: $29.95
- Storage: $1.60
- Data Transfer: $0.45
- S3 Usage: $2.50

### One-Time Setup: 4-7 hours
- Infrastructure setup: 1-2 hours
- Application deployment: 2-3 hours
- Production hardening: 1-2 hours

## Required Resources

### AWS Infrastructure
- AWS account with billing enabled
- EC2 instance (t3.medium)
- S3 bucket access (existing)
- Security group configuration

### Credentials
- AWS Access Keys
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- S3 bucket permissions
- Domain name (optional)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Application already tested locally
- Uses standard AWS services
- No external database dependencies

### Mitigation
- Regular security updates
- Automated backups
- Monitoring and logging
- Rollback plan maintained

## Benefits

### Operational
- ✅ Always online (99.9% uptime)
- ✅ Accessible from anywhere
- ✅ Professional monitoring
- ✅ Automated backups

### Technical
- ✅ Scalable infrastructure
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Easy maintenance
- ✅ Version control integration

### Business
- ✅ Reliable service delivery
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Cost-effective solution
- ✅ Future-proof architecture

## Recommendation

**Proceed with EC2 deployment** for the following reasons:

1. **Cost-Effective**: $34.50/month is reasonable for always-on service
2. **Reliable**: Eliminates dependency on local development machine
3. **Professional**: Production-grade infrastructure and monitoring
4. **Scalable**: Easy to upgrade as usage grows
5. **Secure**: AWS security best practices and compliance

## Next Steps

1. **Approve budget** ($34.50/month)
2. **Provide AWS access** and credentials
3. **Schedule deployment** (4-7 hours)
4. **Configure monitoring** and alerts
5. **Test and validate** functionality

## Success Metrics

- Application uptime > 99%
- Response time < 2 seconds
- Zero data loss
- Successful backup verification
- User satisfaction with reliability
